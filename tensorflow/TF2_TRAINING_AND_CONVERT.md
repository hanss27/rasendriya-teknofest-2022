# TensorFlow 2 Training and Convert
![Inference video](https://github.com/rizkymille/rasendriya-auav-ui/blob/main/tensorflow/inference.gif)  
To make custom object detection and inferencing it like above video, you must train the TensorFlow 2 pre trained model with your dataset. This training will generate new model which suits to your dataset. Those new model will be converted to TensorFlow Lite format and C array, which more suitable for microcontroller capability.
## Preparing Dataset
Please look at: Dataset Workflow
## Selecting Pre Trained Model
TensorFlow 2 has bunch of pre trained m
