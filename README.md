# Rasendriya  
Rasendriya is a lightweight fixed wing UAV from AUAV UI for TÃ¼bitak International Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Teknofest Competition. For Tubitak 2021, Rasendriya has two missions: Flying in oval track and loiter in one point with small radius, and flying in oval track for 3 laps and dropping two payloads in a designated dropzone. The designated dropzone must be found autonomously by using computer vision system.
