Rasendriya is a lightweight fixed wing UAV from AUAV UI for TÃ¼bitak International Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Teknofest Competition.

For Tubitak 2021, Rasendriya has two missions: Flying in oval track and loiter in one point with small radius, and flying in oval track for 3 laps while dropping two payloads in a designated dropzone. The designated dropzone must be found autonomously by using computer vision system.

## Mission Details
### Mission 1
Mission 1 consist of flying in oval track and loiter in pole with small radius. No computer vision required.
### Mission 2
Mission 2 also similar to mission 1. But instead of flying in oval track, the plane must track the dropzone and drop the payload 2 times.
